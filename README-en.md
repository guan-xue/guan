# Tuberism/Supervism/Adjudicatism/...

## Prologue

Tuberism, or Supervism, is proposed in the time of postmodernism such as today, addressing the problem of whether supervising or adjudicating all of, or some part of, a social event, or a personal affair, is just, fruitful, entertaining, or absolutely meaningless. **The english representation of such a concept remains a matter of dispute.**

Around 2000 days ago, it was pointed out by Jacky Chen 成龙, winner of Academy Honorary Award, that it is merely natural for Chinese people to be ruled and supervised. Therefore, he is generally considered to be the pioneer of this concept we all find so important.

As the internet connects everyone and everything altogether, all kinds of problems are presented to the people, so are the potential solutions, among which people often resort to an authority settling disputes & injustice. So it is, that the talk of "stronger adjudication/supervision/dictatorship" finds itself popular.

To adjudicate or not to adjudicate, that is the question.
